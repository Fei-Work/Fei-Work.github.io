Regarding the concept of **vector space**, Wikipedia explains it as follows:

 *A **vector space** is a special **set** formed by a group of mathematical fields (such as [real numbers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/實數) or even [functions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/函数)) that can be **scaled** and **added**, with the unique characteristic that the resulting vectors after scaling and addition **still belong to this set***.

I find this perspective on understanding vector spaces quite fitting and decided to adopt it directly.



# Vector Space and Subspace

## Representation of Vector Space

Here, We will discuss vector spaces only in the context of real numbers, where vector spaces are represented as $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n$ indicating the dimension of the vectors in the vector space. For $\{v\in\mathbb{R}^1\}$, $v$ can be any one-dimensional vector $\begin{bmatrix}x\end{bmatrix}$, for $\{v\in\mathbb{R}^2\}$, $v$ can be any two-dimensional vector $\begin{bmatrix}x \ y\end{bmatrix}^T$, and so forth. When we mention space, we can geometrically visualize $\mathbb{R}^1$ as a line, $\mathbb{R}^2$ as a plane, and $\mathbb{R}^3$ as the entirety of three-dimensional space, While we cannot imagine higher dimensions, we can remember that the vectors belonging to a vector space, after scaling and addition, **still belong to this set**.

## Subspace

The concept of subspace is significant within vector spaces. Simply put, a subspace is also a vector space that depends on another vector space. When we mention "sub," it implies that a **set of vectors** is contained within its dependent **vector space $S$** and meets the conditions required to form a vector space. Thus, it can be termed a **subspace of vector space $S$*.

In the two scenarios below, according to the above rules, it is clear that (a) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, while (b) is not.

## Column Space and Null Space

For an $m×n$ real matrix $A$, its **column space** is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ generated by all the **column vectors** of the matrix $A$, denoted as $C(A)$.

The **null space** of an  $m×n$  real matrix $B$ is the set of all solutions $v$ to the equation $Bv=0$, denoted as $\mathrm{Null}(B) $.
